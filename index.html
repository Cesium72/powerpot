          <p>
            With PowerPot's unique approach on gardening, you can easily own a
            beautiful plant in your home without fearing the stress of
            taking care of it. PowerPot has a large database of both common and
            endangered plants, and will automatically water your plant as
            needed. You can buy attachments to warm and illuminate your plant,
            and PowerPot also can also read the ambient tempurature, humidity, and air pressure of the surrounding environment. You will even get alerts on your phone with an image of you plant if you need to
            refill the water basin or if your plant needs some help.

          <h3>Profits Go to Protect Native Species and Biodiverity</h3>
          <div class="bar"></div>
          <p>
            As humans leave their deep footsteps on this planet, we bring
            species to areas where they are not supposed to be. This makes
            invasive species take over areas, and use up resources, sometimes even killing the
            native plants. Some frequently seen invasive plants in the U.S. are
            dandelions and common grass. Native plants are beautiful and help
            preserve the local ecosystem, so PowerPot donates 30% of profits to
            help native biodiversity conversation institutes in Denver, like
            Denver Parks and Rec., and the Denver Botanic Gardens.

          <h3>For all Plants, Big or Small, Desert or Jungle</h3>
          <div class="bar"></div>
          <p>
            Unlike other electronic plant pots, PowerPot comes in many different
            sizes, so you can take care of plants of any shape and size. You can
            also customize a water level, water frequency, temperature, and even light amount
            so that your plant is happy and healthy, always.
